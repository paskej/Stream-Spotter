Then change "Active Solution Configuration" to "Release" and uncheck the "Build" box correlating to UnitTests. Close the Configuration Manager and Build the program. The .exe should be located in "StreamSpotter\StreamSpotter\bin\Release" The "bin" file can then be placed anywhere in the file system and StreamSpotter.exe will run.
